# Hello-World
Starter tutorial
Hello, My name is Daniel or Dalendo/Dalendus as my social media handles are. 
I know how to program with Java and C# and am currently finding new things to learn and grow as a programmer.
I have some college experience, about 60 credit hrs or more in Computer Science.
The reason I haven't completed my degree yet is because I'm poor and unfortunate. lol
So, I'm currently paying off student loans and such.
